# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Invoice Data Model
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create data models for invoices and line items in the database.
# Details:
1. Define Invoice model with fields: id, user_id, source, invoice_date, vendor, total_amount, status, file_path, created_at, updated_at
2. Define LineItem model with fields: id, invoice_id, description, quantity, unit_price, total_price
3. Implement database migrations for these models
4. Create indexes for frequently queried fields
5. Implement model methods for common operations

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify database schema matches the defined models
2. Test model creation and querying
3. Ensure indexes are properly created
4. Test model methods for accuracy

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Data Models [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and specify the data models, including entities, attributes, and relationships, ensuring normalization and clarity.
### Details:
Identify all necessary entities and their relationships based on business requirements. Apply normalization principles to reduce redundancy and ensure data integrity.

## 2. Create Migration Scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop migration scripts to create and update database schemas according to the defined data models.
### Details:
Write scripts that generate tables, columns, and relationships as per the model definitions. Ensure scripts are idempotent and support versioning for future changes.

## 3. Implement Index Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Design and implement indexes to optimize query performance based on expected access patterns.
### Details:
Analyze query requirements and add appropriate indexes to tables. Consider primary keys, foreign keys, and frequently queried columns.

## 4. Develop Model Methods [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement methods on the data models for common operations such as create, read, update, and delete (CRUD).
### Details:
Define and code reusable functions or methods for interacting with the data models, ensuring encapsulation of business logic.

## 5. Implement Schema Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Set up schema validation to enforce data integrity and correctness at the application or database level.
### Details:
Define validation rules for each model attribute, such as data types, required fields, and value constraints. Integrate validation into model methods and/or database constraints.
