# Task ID: 24
# Title: Optimize Database Queries and Implement Caching
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 11
# Priority: low
# Description: Optimize database queries and implement caching for improved performance.
# Details:
1. Analyze and optimize existing database queries
2. Implement database indexing for frequently accessed fields
3. Set up Redis caching for frequently accessed data
4. Implement cache invalidation strategy
5. Add performance monitoring

# Test Strategy:
1. Benchmark query performance before and after optimization
2. Verify cache hit rates
3. Test cache invalidation
4. Ensure performance improvements under load

# Subtasks:
## 1. Query Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze current query patterns, identify bottlenecks, and determine optimization opportunities using tools like EXPLAIN ANALYZE and by reviewing query structure and data access patterns.
### Details:
Review SQL queries for inefficiencies, such as unnecessary columns, suboptimal joins, or lack of filtering. Use query analysis tools to measure execution time and resource usage. Document findings and suggest improvements.

## 2. Index Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Design and implement appropriate indexes based on the query analysis to improve data retrieval performance.
### Details:
Identify columns frequently used in WHERE clauses, JOINs, and ORDER BY statements. Create indexes on these columns and validate their effectiveness by re-running query analysis tools.

## 3. Redis Caching Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.2
### Description: Integrate Redis caching for frequently accessed data to reduce database load and improve response times.
### Details:
Determine which queries or data sets are suitable for caching based on access patterns. Implement Redis caching for these, ensuring proper serialization and deserialization of data.

## 4. Cache Invalidation Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.3
### Description: Develop and implement a cache invalidation strategy to ensure data consistency between Redis cache and the primary database.
### Details:
Choose appropriate invalidation mechanisms such as time-to-live (TTL), event-based invalidation, or manual cache clearing. Balance data freshness with performance and document the chosen approach.

## 5. Performance Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.4
### Description: Set up monitoring for query performance, index usage, and cache efficiency to ensure ongoing optimization and quickly identify regressions.
### Details:
Implement tools and dashboards to track query execution times, cache hit/miss rates, and index effectiveness. Set up alerts for abnormal patterns and regularly review metrics for further optimization.
