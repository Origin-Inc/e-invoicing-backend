# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Error Tracking with Sentry
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate Sentry for error tracking in both frontend and backend.
# Details:
1. Set up Sentry project
2. Install Sentry SDK for Python and JavaScript
3. Configure Sentry in backend (FastAPI)
4. Set up Sentry in frontend (Next.js)
5. Implement custom error boundaries in React
6. Configure environment-based Sentry settings

# Test Strategy:
1. Test error capturing in backend
2. Verify frontend error tracking
3. Ensure environment-specific configuration works
4. Test custom error boundaries

# Subtasks:
## 1. Sentry Project Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new project in your Sentry account, select the appropriate platform (Python, JavaScript, etc.), and note down the DSN and project details.
### Details:
Log in to Sentry, click 'Create a Project', choose your backend/frontend type, and record the DSN, organization slug, and project name for later configuration.

## 2. SDK Installation (Python/JS) [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Install the Sentry SDK in both backend (Python) and frontend (JavaScript/React) environments.
### Details:
For Python: pip install sentry-sdk. For JavaScript: npm install @sentry/browser (or @sentry/react for React apps).

## 3. Backend Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.2
### Description: Configure the Sentry SDK in your backend (Python) application using the DSN and environment variables.
### Details:
Initialize Sentry in your backend code (e.g., sentry_sdk.init(dsn=..., environment=...)) and ensure environment-specific settings are applied.

## 4. Frontend Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.2
### Description: Configure the Sentry SDK in your frontend (JavaScript/React) application using the DSN and environment variables.
### Details:
Initialize Sentry in your main JS/React entry point (e.g., Sentry.init({ dsn: ..., environment: ... })) and ensure environment-specific settings are applied.

## 5. React Error Boundaries Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.4
### Description: Integrate Sentry's React ErrorBoundary component to capture and report React component errors.
### Details:
Wrap your React app or specific components with Sentry's ErrorBoundary to automatically capture and report uncaught errors in the UI.

## 6. Environment-Based Settings [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.3, 22.4
### Description: Set up environment-based configuration for Sentry in both backend and frontend, ensuring sensitive data is managed securely.
### Details:
Use environment variables (e.g., SENTRY_DSN, SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT) and .env files to manage Sentry settings for development, staging, and production environments.
