# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Login Page [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a login page UI that allows users to enter their credentials and triggers the authentication process, handling form state and error feedback.
### Details:
Design a form with username and password fields. On submit, call the authentication API and handle the response, storing tokens as needed.

Build a form for user registration. On submit, send data to the registration API and handle success or error responses appropriately.

## 3. Create User Context [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2
### Description: Set up a React context to manage and provide user authentication state and actions (login, logout, token storage) throughout the app.
### Details:
Implement a context provider that stores user info and tokens, exposes login/logout methods, and persists state across reloads.

## 4. Develop Protected Route HOC [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.3
### Description: Create a higher-order component (HOC) or wrapper to restrict access to certain routes based on authentication state from User Context.
### Details:
Ensure only authenticated users can access protected routes, redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page.

## 5. Implement Logout Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.3
### Description: Add a logout mechanism that clears user authentication state and tokens, updating the UI and redirecting as needed.
### Details:
Provide a logout button or menu item that, when clicked, resets the User Context and navigates the user to a public page.

## 6. Build Token Refresh UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.3
### Description: Design and implement UI and logic to handle token refresh, ensuring seamless user experience when tokens expire.
### Details:
Detect token expiration, trigger refresh flow, and update User Context with new tokens. Optionally, show loading or error states during refresh.
