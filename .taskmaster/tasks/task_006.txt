# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Gmail OAuth2 Authentication
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create Gmail OAuth2 flow for secure email access.
# Details:
1. Set up Google Cloud project and enable Gmail API
2. Install Google Auth library: `poetry add google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2`
3. Implement OAuth2 flow initiation endpoint
4. Create callback endpoint for handling OAuth2 response
5. Implement secure token storage in Supabase (encrypted)
6. Create token refresh mechanism

# Test Strategy:
1. Test OAuth2 flow initiation
2. Verify callback handling and token storage
3. Test token refresh functionality
4. Ensure tokens are properly encrypted at rest

# Subtasks:
## 1. Google Cloud Console Project Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and configure a new project in the Google Cloud Console. Enable required APIs and generate OAuth2 credentials (client ID and secret) following security best practices.
### Details:
Ensure that only necessary APIs are enabled, restrict credentials to trusted origins, and follow Google Cloud's security recommendations for credential management.

## 2. Library Installation and Environment Preparation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Install necessary libraries and SDKs for OAuth2 integration and Google Cloud API access in the development environment.
### Details:
Use official libraries (e.g., google-auth, google-api-python-client) and ensure all dependencies are up to date. Set up environment variables for sensitive data.

## 3. Initiate OAuth2 Authorization Flow [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Implement the OAuth2 authorization code flow initiation, redirecting users to the Google consent screen with the correct scopes and redirect URI.
### Details:
Ensure the client_id and redirect_uri match those configured in the Google Cloud Console. Use HTTPS for all endpoints and log all authorization attempts securely.

## 4. Handle OAuth2 Callback and Token Exchange [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Implement the callback endpoint to handle the authorization code returned by Google, exchanging it for access and refresh tokens securely.
### Details:
Validate the state parameter to prevent CSRF attacks. Use secure HTTPS endpoints and handle errors gracefully, logging failures for audit purposes.

## 5. Secure Token Storage Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Design and implement secure storage for access and refresh tokens, following best practices to prevent unauthorized access or leakage.
### Details:
Encrypt tokens at rest, restrict access to storage, and avoid exposing tokens in logs or client-side code. Rotate and revoke tokens as needed.

## 6. Token Refresh and Error Handling Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.5
### Description: Implement logic to refresh access tokens using the refresh token and handle token expiration or revocation errors securely.
### Details:
Automatically refresh tokens before expiration, handle refresh failures by prompting re-authentication, and log all token-related errors securely.
