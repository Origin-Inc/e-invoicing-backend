# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Invoice Management API Endpoints
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create API endpoints for invoice management operations.
# Details:

2. Create GET /invoices/{id} endpoint for single invoice details
3. Implement PUT /invoices/{id} for manual corrections
4. Create DELETE /invoices/{id} endpoint
5. Implement input validation and sanitization
6. Add appropriate error handling

# Test Strategy:
1. Test each endpoint for correct functionality
2. Verify pagination, filtering, and sorting work correctly
3. Test input validation and error handling
4. Ensure proper authorization checks

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design List Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a RESTful endpoint to retrieve a paginated and filterable list of resources, following best practices for naming and HTTP method usage.
### Details:
Use GET /api/resources with support for pagination and filtering parameters. Ensure endpoint uses plural nouns and clear naming conventions.

## 2. Design Detail Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1

### Details:
Use GET /api/resources/{id} to fetch a specific resource. Ensure proper error handling for not found cases.

## 3. Design Update Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Create an endpoint to update an existing resource, supporting both full and partial updates as appropriate.
### Details:
Use PUT or PATCH /api/resources/{id} for updates. Validate input and handle errors for invalid or missing data.

## 4. Design Delete Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Develop an endpoint to delete a resource by its unique identifier, ensuring proper response codes and error handling.
### Details:
Use DELETE /api/resources/{id}. Return appropriate status codes for success and handle cases where the resource does not exist.

## 5. Implement Input Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4
### Description: Add input validation for all endpoints to ensure data integrity and prevent invalid requests.
### Details:
Validate request bodies and query parameters for required fields, types, and constraints. Return clear error messages for validation failures.

## 6. Implement Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.5
### Description: Integrate comprehensive error handling across all endpoints to provide consistent and informative error responses.
### Details:
Standardize error response formats, handle common error scenarios (e.g., 400, 404, 500), and ensure errors are logged for monitoring.
