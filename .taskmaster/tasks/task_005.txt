# Task ID: 5
# Title: Setup Redis and Celery Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Redis as a message broker and Celery for background job processing.
# Details:
1. Install Redis and Celery: `poetry add redis celery`
2. Configure Redis connection in FastAPI app
3. Set up Celery app with Redis as broker
4. Create basic task structure for background jobs
5. Implement Celery worker in Docker setup

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify Redis connection
2. Test Celery task execution
3. Ensure background jobs are properly queued and processed

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and Configure Redis [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Redis as the message broker and result backend for Celery. Ensure Redis is running and accessible, either locally or via Docker.
### Details:
Install Redis on your system or include it as a service in your Docker Compose file. Verify connectivity on the default port (6379).

## 2. Install and Set Up Celery [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Install Celery and configure it to use Redis as both the broker and backend. Ensure Celery can connect to the running Redis instance.
### Details:
Add Celery and redis-py to your requirements, then configure Celery in your Python code with the appropriate Redis URLs for broker and backend.

## 3. Integrate Celery with FastAPI [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Connect Celery to your FastAPI application, enabling FastAPI endpoints to trigger Celery tasks asynchronously.
### Details:
Import and initialize Celery in your FastAPI app. Create example tasks and expose endpoints that enqueue these tasks.

## 4. Design Task Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Define and organize Celery tasks, ensuring clear separation between task definitions and FastAPI route handlers.
### Details:
Create a dedicated tasks module or file. Implement sample tasks (e.g., background email sending, data processing) and ensure they are registered with Celery.

## 5. Configure Docker for FastAPI, Celery Worker, and Redis [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Set up Docker Compose to orchestrate FastAPI, Celery worker, and Redis services, ensuring proper networking and environment configuration.
### Details:
Write Dockerfiles and a docker-compose.yml file to build and run all services. Verify inter-service communication and test the full asynchronous workflow.
