# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Development Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with Poetry for dependency management and set up the development environment with Docker and Docker Compose.
# Details:
1. Create a new Git repository
2. Initialize Poetry project with `poetry init`
3. Set Python version to 3.11 in pyproject.toml
4. Create a multi-stage Dockerfile for Python 3.11
5. Create a docker-compose.yml file with services for API, Worker, Redis, and PostgreSQL
6. Set up environment variable configuration
7. Implement health checks for all services
8. Configure volume mounts for development

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify Poetry can install dependencies
2. Ensure Docker containers can be built and run
3. Check if services can communicate with each other
4. Validate environment variables are properly loaded
5. Test health check endpoints

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Git Repository [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new Git repository for the project to enable version control.
### Details:

## 2. Configure Python 3.11 Environment [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Ensure the project uses Python 3.11 (not 3.13) for all development and deployment steps.
### Details:
Set up Python 3.11 locally using pyenv or system package manager. Update project documentation and configuration files to specify Python 3.11 as the required version.

## 3. Set Up Poetry for Dependency Management [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Install and configure Poetry to manage Python dependencies and project metadata.
### Details:
Install Poetry, run 'poetry init' to create pyproject.toml, and configure Poetry to use the system Python 3.11 interpreter. Add required dependencies.

## 4. Create Multi-Stage Dockerfile Using Python 3.11 [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Write a multi-stage Dockerfile that uses Python 3.11 for both build and runtime stages, integrating Poetry for dependency installation.
### Details:
Base the build stage on 'python:3.11-slim', install Poetry, copy project files, and install dependencies. Use a clean 'python:3.11-alpine' or similar for the runtime stage, copying only necessary artifacts from the builder stage.[1][5]

## 5. Configure Docker Compose with Required Services [done]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Set up docker-compose.yml to orchestrate the application container and any additional services (e.g., databases).
### Details:
Define services, specify build context, set up environment variables, volume mounts, and health checks as needed. Ensure the Python service uses the multi-stage Dockerfile and Python 3.11.

## 6. Set Up Environment Variables Management [done]
### Dependencies: 1.5
### Description: Configure environment variable handling for both local development and Dockerized environments.
### Details:
Define required environment variables in .env files and ensure they are referenced in Docker Compose and the application code. Document all variables.

## 7. Implement Health Checks and Volume Mounts [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add health check configurations and set up volume mounts for persistent data and live code reloading.
### Details:
Configure healthcheck directives in docker-compose.yml for all relevant services. Set up volume mounts for source code and data directories as needed.

## 8. Verify and Test Each Setup Component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Individually verify the correct setup and operation of Git, Python 3.11, Poetry, Dockerfile, Docker Compose, environment variables, health checks, and volume mounts.
### Details:
For each component: run status checks (e.g., 'git status', 'python --version', 'poetry check', 'docker build', 'docker-compose up'), confirm expected behavior, and document verification results.
