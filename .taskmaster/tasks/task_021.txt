# Task ID: 21
# Title: Setup CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement Continuous Integration and Deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions.
# Details:
1. Create GitHub Actions workflow file
2. Set up automated testing for backend and frontend
3. Implement Docker image building and pushing
4. Configure deployment to Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend)
5. Set up environment-specific configurations
6. Implement database migration step

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify automated tests run on push and pull requests
2. Ensure Docker images are correctly built and pushed
3. Test deployment to staging environment
4. Verify database migrations are applied correctly

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create CI/CD Workflow File [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and create the CI/CD workflow configuration file that orchestrates the entire pipeline including build, test, and deploy stages.
### Details:
Write a YAML or equivalent workflow file specifying triggers (e.g., on commit or pull request), jobs for backend and frontend tests, Docker build and push, deployment steps, and migration handling.

## 2. Implement Backend Automated Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Develop and integrate automated tests for backend services to ensure code quality and functionality before deployment.
### Details:
Write unit, integration, and possibly end-to-end tests for backend code. Configure the CI workflow to run these tests automatically on code changes.

## 3. Implement Frontend Automated Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Develop and integrate automated tests for frontend applications to verify UI and functionality.
### Details:
Create unit and UI tests for frontend code. Integrate these tests into the CI workflow to run on every commit or pull request.

## 4. Docker Image Build and Push [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.2, 21.3
### Description: Build Docker images for backend and frontend services and push them to a container registry.
### Details:
Configure the CI workflow to build Docker images after successful tests, tag them appropriately, and push to a Docker registry for deployment use.

## 5. Configure Deployment to Render and Vercel [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.4
### Description: Set up deployment configurations and automate deployment of backend services to Render and frontend to Vercel.
### Details:
Write deployment scripts or use platform-specific integrations in the CI workflow to deploy backend Docker images to Render and frontend builds to Vercel automatically.

## 6. Implement Database Migration Step [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.5
### Description: Add a migration step in the CI/CD pipeline to handle database schema changes safely before or during deployment.
### Details:
Integrate database migration commands or tools into the deployment process to ensure the database schema is updated in sync with application deployments.
