# Task ID: 15
# Title: Setup Next.js Frontend Project
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize and configure the Next.js frontend project with TypeScript.
# Details:
1. Create Next.js project: `npx create-next-app@latest --typescript`
2. Set up project structure (pages, components, styles)
3. Configure TypeScript
4. Set up API client for backend communication
5. Implement basic routing
6. Set up environment variable handling

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify TypeScript compilation
2. Test basic routing functionality
3. Ensure API client can communicate with backend
4. Check environment variable loading

# Subtasks:
## 1. Project Initialization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the initial frontend project using a modern build tool (e.g., Vite) to ensure fast development and optimized builds.
### Details:
Run the appropriate command to scaffold a new project, select the framework (React, Vue, etc.), and initialize version control.

## 2. Structure Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Establish a robust folder and file structure for the frontend application to support scalability and maintainability.
### Details:
Create directories for components, pages, assets, utilities, and other relevant modules following best practices for front-end architecture.

## 3. TypeScript Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Configure TypeScript for static type checking and improved developer experience.
### Details:
Install TypeScript, generate a tsconfig.json, and adjust compiler options for the project's needs. Optionally, set up ESLint for code quality.

## 4. API Client Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.3
### Description: Implement an API client to handle communication with backend services.
### Details:
Choose or create an HTTP client (e.g., Axios, Fetch wrapper), set up base configuration, and organize API endpoint modules.

## 5. Routing Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.3
### Description: Set up client-side routing to enable navigation between different views or pages.
### Details:
Install and configure a routing library (e.g., React Router, Vue Router), define route structures, and implement navigation components.

## 6. Environment Variable Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Configure environment variable management for secure and flexible configuration.
### Details:
Set up .env files, configure the build tool to load environment variables, and document usage for API keys, endpoints, and other sensitive data.
