# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement FastAPI Backend Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the FastAPI backend structure with basic routing and configuration.
# Details:
1. Install FastAPI and dependencies using Poetry: `poetry add fastapi uvicorn[standard]`
2. Create main.py with FastAPI app initialization
3. Set up basic routing structure
4. Implement CORS middleware
5. Configure API versioning
6. Implement rate limiting using FastAPI-limiter
7. Set up environment-specific configurations

# Test Strategy:
1. Write unit tests for basic routing
2. Test CORS functionality
3. Verify rate limiting is working
4. Ensure different environment configurations load correctly

# Subtasks:
## 1. Dependency Installation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install all required dependencies for the backend project, including the web framework, middleware, and testing libraries.
### Details:
Use the package manager (e.g., npm, pip) to install core dependencies such as the web server framework, CORS middleware, rate limiter, dotenv for environment configs, and testing tools.

## 2. App Initialization [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Initialize the backend application structure and entry point.
### Details:
Set up the main application file, configure the server to listen on a port, and ensure the project structure supports modular development.

## 3. Routing Setup [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Configure routing for the API endpoints following RESTful conventions.
### Details:
Define routes for resources using plural nouns and appropriate HTTP methods. Organize routes in separate modules if necessary.

## 4. CORS Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Enable and configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the API.
### Details:
Integrate CORS middleware and set up allowed origins, methods, and headers as needed for secure cross-origin requests.

## 5. API Versioning [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Implement versioning for the API endpoints.
### Details:
Prefix routes with version identifiers (e.g., /v1/) to support future changes without breaking existing clients.

## 6. Rate Limiting Middleware [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Add and configure rate limiting to protect the API from excessive requests.
### Details:
Integrate a rate limiting middleware and set thresholds for requests per time window to prevent abuse.

## 7. Environment Configuration and Basic Test Coverage [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6
### Description: Set up environment variable management and implement basic test coverage for critical setup components.
### Details:
Use dotenv or similar to manage environment variables. Write and run basic tests to verify that routing, CORS, versioning, and rate limiting are correctly configured.

## Implementation Improvements Made

### Security & Production Readiness:
- **Fixed CORS Configuration**: Changed from wildcard `allow_origins=["*"]` to configurable origins via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable
- **Restricted HTTP Methods**: Limited to specific methods instead of `allow_methods=["*"]`
- **Environment-based Configuration**: CORS origins now configurable per environment

### Modern FastAPI Practices:
- **Upgraded to Lifespan Handlers**: Replaced deprecated `@app.on_event("startup")` with modern `@asynccontextmanager` lifespan pattern
- **Added Proper Error Handling**: Redis connection failures now gracefully degrade instead of crashing the app
- **Added Logging**: Proper logging for rate limiter initialization status

### Rate Limiting Strategy:
- **Created Reusable Rate Limiting Utils**: `src/utils/rate_limiting.py` with different configurations for different endpoint types
- **Removed Rate Limiting from Health Checks**: Health endpoints should not be rate limited for monitoring
- **Flexible Rate Limiting**: Different limits for different endpoint types (strict, moderate, lenient)

### Testing Improvements:
- **Proper Test Structure**: Tests now verify actual functionality without complex mocking
- **Simplified Test App**: Created dedicated test app for reliable testing
- **Better Test Coverage**: Tests for both rate-limited and non-rate-limited endpoints

### Configuration Management:
- **Updated Environment Variables**: Added `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and `ENVIRONMENT` settings
- **Better Default Values**: Sensible defaults for development while allowing production customization

These changes address major security vulnerabilities, use modern FastAPI patterns, and create a more maintainable codebase for future development.
