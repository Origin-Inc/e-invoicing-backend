# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Security Best Practices
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance system security by implementing additional security measures.
# Details:
1. Implement HTTPS enforcement
2. Set up CORS policies
3. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
4. Add rate limiting to sensitive endpoints
5. Implement secure headers (X-XSS-Protection, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
6. Conduct security audit and penetration testing

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify HTTPS enforcement
2. Test CORS policies
3. Ensure CSP is working correctly
4. Test rate limiting functionality
5. Verify secure headers are present
6. Conduct and review results of security audit

# Subtasks:
## 1. Enforce HTTPS and HSTS [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement HTTPS across all web services, ensure automatic redirection from HTTP to HTTPS, and configure HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to enforce secure connections.
### Details:
Set up HTTPS certificates, configure web servers to redirect HTTP to HTTPS, and add HSTS headers. Consider HSTS preloading for additional security. Use online tools to verify SSL/TLS configuration and compliance.

## 2. Configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Set up CORS policies to control which domains can access resources, preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests.
### Details:
Define allowed origins, methods, and headers in server configuration. Test CORS settings to ensure legitimate requests are permitted and unauthorized requests are blocked.

## 3. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.2
### Description: Deploy a Content Security Policy to restrict sources of executable scripts, styles, and other resources, mitigating XSS and data injection attacks.
### Details:
Draft and apply a CSP header tailored to the application's needs. Monitor violation reports and adjust the policy to balance security and functionality.

## 4. Set Up Rate Limiting [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.3
### Description: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse, brute-force attacks, and denial-of-service attempts by restricting the number of requests per user or IP.
### Details:
Configure rate limiting rules in the application or at the proxy level. Monitor logs for excessive requests and tune thresholds as needed.

## 5. Apply Secure HTTP Headers [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.4
### Description: Add and configure secure HTTP headers such as X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and Referrer-Policy to enhance browser-side security.
### Details:
Review recommended secure headers, implement them in server configuration, and verify their presence and correctness using security scanning tools.

## 6. Conduct Security Audit and Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.5
### Description: Perform comprehensive security audits and penetration testing to validate the effectiveness of implemented controls and identify vulnerabilities.
### Details:
Use automated scanners and manual testing to assess security posture. Address any findings and retest to ensure robust protection.
