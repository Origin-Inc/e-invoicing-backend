# Task ID: 3
# Title: Setup Supabase Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Supabase for PostgreSQL database and storage functionality.
# Details:
1. Install Supabase Python client: `poetry add supabase`
2. Set up Supabase project and obtain API keys
3. Implement database connection using Supabase client
4. Configure Supabase Storage for file storage
5. Implement basic CRUD operations for database
6. Set up row-level security policies in Supabase

# Test Strategy:
1. Test database connection
2. Verify CRUD operations work correctly
3. Ensure file upload and retrieval from Supabase Storage works
4. Test row-level security policies

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install Supabase Client Library [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install the Supabase Python client library (v2.15.3) in your project using poetry.
### Details:
Run `poetry add supabase` to add the Supabase Python client to your project.

## 2. Set Up Supabase Project [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Initialize a new Supabase project and obtain the necessary API keys.
### Details:
Create a new project in the Supabase dashboard, then retrieve your project URL and anon/public API key for use in your Python application.

## 3. Establish Database Connection [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Configure the Supabase Python client to connect to your Supabase database instance.
### Details:
Use your Supabase project URL and anon/public API key to create a client instance in your Python application code. Example: `client = create_client(supabase_url, supabase_key)`.

## 4. Configure Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Set up and configure Supabase Storage for handling file uploads and downloads using the Python client.
### Details:
Enable and configure storage buckets in the Supabase dashboard, and implement Python code to interact with Supabase Storage using the client's storage methods.

## 5. Implement CRUD Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Develop Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality using the Supabase Python client.
### Details:
Use the Supabase Python client methods to interact with your database tables for CRUD operations. For example: `client.table('your_table').insert(data).execute()` for creating records.

## 6. Set Up Security Policies [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4, 3.5
### Description: Configure Row Level Security (RLS) and other security policies for your Supabase database and storage.
### Details:
Define and enable RLS policies in the Supabase dashboard or via SQL migrations to control access to your data and storage resources. Test these policies with your Python client implementation.
