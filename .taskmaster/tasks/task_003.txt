## Switching to Local Supabase Development

**Decision Made**: Setting up local Supabase development instead of cloud for better development experience.

### Benefits of Local Setup:
- No internet dependency for development
- Faster development cycles
- No API rate limits or costs
- Version control database schema
- Easy data reset/seeding
- Integrates with existing Docker workflow

### Next Steps:
1. Install Supabase CLI
2. Initialize local Supabase project
3. Update environment variables for local setup
4. Integrate with existing Docker compose setup

### Local Setup Instructions:

1. **Install Supabase CLI:**
   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm install -g supabase
   
   # Or using Homebrew (macOS)
   brew install supabase/tap/supabase
   ```

2. **Initialize Local Project:**
   ```bash
   # Create a supabase directory in your project
   mkdir -p supabase
   cd supabase
   
   # Initialize local project
   supabase init
   ```

3. **Start Local Supabase:**
   ```bash
   supabase start
   ```

4. **Update Environment Variables:**
   ```
   # Local development environment variables
   SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
   SUPABASE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...  # Use the anon key provided after 'supabase start'
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5c... # Use the service_role key provided
   ```

5. **Docker Integration:**
   Add to your existing docker-compose.yml:
   ```yaml
   services:
     # Your existing services...
     
     supabase:
       image: supabase/supabase-local
       ports:
         - "54321:54321"
       volumes:
         - ./supabase:/supabase
   ```

**Note:** The existing Supabase client configuration should work with both cloud and local setups as long as the environment variables are updated accordingly.

## 3. Establish Database Connection [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Configure the Supabase Python client to connect to your Supabase database instance.
### Details:
Use your Supabase project URL and anon/public API key to create a client instance in your Python application code. Example: `client = create_client(supabase_url, supabase_key)`.
