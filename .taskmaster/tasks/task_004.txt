# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement User Authentication
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create user authentication system using Supabase authentication.
# Details:
1. Set up Supabase Authentication
2. Implement sign-up and login endpoints
3. Create JWT token generation and validation
4. Implement user session management
5. Create middleware for protected routes

# Test Strategy:
1. Test user registration process
2. Verify login functionality
3. Ensure JWT tokens are properly generated and validated
4. Test protected routes with and without valid tokens

# Subtasks:
## 1. Supabase Authentication Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize Supabase in the project and configure authentication providers (email/password, OAuth, etc.) as needed.
### Details:
Set up a new Supabase project, connect it to your app, and enable the desired authentication methods using the Supabase dashboard and client SDKs.

## 2. Endpoint Creation for Auth Actions [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create API endpoints for user registration, login, logout, and profile management using Supabase Auth SDK.
### Details:
Implement endpoints that interact with Supabase Auth for sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, and user profile retrieval or updates.

## 3. JWT Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Implement logic to handle JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) issued by Supabase for authenticated users.
### Details:
Extract, validate, and securely store JWTs on the client side. Ensure tokens are sent with requests to protected endpoints and handle token refresh if needed.

## 4. Session Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Manage user sessions using Supabase Auth session utilities and handle session persistence and expiration.
### Details:
Use Supabase's session management features to track user authentication state, persist sessions across reloads, and handle session expiration or renewal.

## 5. Middleware for Protected Routes [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Develop middleware to protect API routes by verifying JWTs and user authentication status.
### Details:
Implement server-side middleware that checks for valid JWTs in incoming requests and restricts access to protected resources based on authentication and authorization.

## 6. Testing Protected Routes [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.5
### Description: Write and execute tests to verify that protected routes are accessible only to authenticated users and that unauthorized access is properly blocked.
### Details:
Create automated tests to simulate authenticated and unauthenticated requests, ensuring that middleware and session management work as intended.
