# Task ID: 8
# Title: Setup Tesseract OCR Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Tesseract OCR for invoice data extraction.
# Details:
1. Install Tesseract OCR and Python binding: `poetry add pytesseract`
2. Set up Tesseract in Docker container
3. Create OCR processing function
4. Implement image preprocessing for better OCR results
5. Extract key invoice data (date, vendor, total, line items)
6. Implement error handling and logging

# Test Strategy:
1. Test OCR processing with sample invoices
2. Verify accuracy of extracted data
3. Test with various invoice formats and layouts
4. Ensure proper error handling and logging

# Subtasks:
## 1. Tesseract Installation in Docker [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a Docker environment with Tesseract OCR installed, ensuring all necessary language packs and dependencies are included.
### Details:
Create a Dockerfile based on a suitable base image (e.g., python:3.12-slim-bookworm). Install Tesseract OCR and required language packs using package managers (apt or apk). Verify Tesseract is accessible within the container.

## 2. Python Environment and OCR Library Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Install Python libraries for OCR and image processing inside the Docker container.
### Details:
Install pytesseract, pdf2image, and other necessary Python packages using pip within the Dockerfile. Ensure the environment is ready for OCR operations.

## 3. Image Preprocessing Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Develop image preprocessing functions to enhance OCR accuracy, handling various image formats and quality issues.
### Details:
Implement preprocessing steps such as grayscale conversion, thresholding, resizing, denoising, and format normalization. Ensure compatibility with common invoice image formats (JPEG, PNG, PDF).

## 4. OCR Function Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Create a robust OCR function that leverages Tesseract to extract text from preprocessed images.
### Details:
Integrate pytesseract with the preprocessing module. Ensure the function can handle batch processing and return raw OCR results for further parsing.

## 5. Structured Data Extraction for Invoices [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Develop logic to parse OCR output and extract structured invoice data: date, vendor, total, and line items.
### Details:
Use regular expressions and/or NLP techniques to identify and extract key invoice fields from OCR text. Structure the output as a JSON object.

## 6. Error Handling and Logging Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.5
### Description: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging for all stages: image loading, preprocessing, OCR, and data extraction.
### Details:
Add try/except blocks, log errors and warnings, and handle unsupported or corrupted image formats gracefully. Ensure logs are accessible for debugging within Docker.
