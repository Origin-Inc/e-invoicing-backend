# Subtasks:
## 1. QuickBooks Developer Account Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create an Intuit developer account and set up a new QuickBooks application for integration.
### Details:
Sign up at developer.intuit.com, fill out the required forms, confirm your email, and create a new app in the developer dashboard. Configure app details, select appropriate scopes, and obtain client credentials (Client ID and Client Secret).

## 2. SDK Installation [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1

### Details:
Choose the SDK matching your programming language (e.g., .NET, Java, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby) and install it using the recommended package manager or download method.

## 3. OAuth Flow Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication to securely connect to QuickBooks Online.
### Details:
Configure OAuth 2.0 credentials in your app, set up redirect URIs, and use the SDK's OAuth client to handle authorization code exchange and token management. Test the flow using the OAuth Playground or sandbox environment.

## 4. Connect Endpoint Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3
### Description: Develop the endpoint that initiates the QuickBooks connection and handles user authorization.
### Details:
Create an endpoint that redirects users to QuickBooks' authorization page and processes the callback to store access tokens securely.

## 5. Export Endpoint Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.4
### Description: Develop the endpoint responsible for exporting invoice data to QuickBooks.
### Details:
Implement logic to receive invoice data, authenticate API requests using stored tokens, and send data to QuickBooks using the SDK.

## 6. Data Mapping Between Invoice Models and QuickBooks Entities [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.5
### Description: Map your application's invoice data model to QuickBooks' invoice entity structure.
### Details:
Analyze both data models, define field mappings, handle required/optional fields, and transform data as needed to match QuickBooks' API requirements.

## 7. Duplicate Checking and Prevention [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement mechanisms to detect and prevent duplicate invoice exports to QuickBooks.
### Details:
Before exporting, check for existing invoices in QuickBooks using unique identifiers or matching criteria. Prevent duplicates by skipping or updating existing records as appropriate.
