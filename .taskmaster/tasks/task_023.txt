# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Basic Monitoring and Health Checks
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up basic monitoring and health check endpoints.
# Details:
1. Implement /health endpoint in FastAPI
2. Create health checks for Redis and PostgreSQL connections
3. Implement /status endpoint for system metrics
4. Set up basic logging for critical operations
5. Configure health check in Docker Compose

# Test Strategy:
1. Test /health endpoint
2. Verify Redis and PostgreSQL health checks
3. Ensure /status endpoint returns correct metrics
4. Test logging functionality

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement FastAPI /health Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a /health endpoint in the FastAPI application to provide a basic health check route.
### Details:
Set up a FastAPI route at /health that returns a simple status indicating the service is running. Use fastapi-health or similar package for extensibility.

## 2. Add Redis Health Check [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Integrate a Redis connectivity check into the /health endpoint to verify Redis availability.
### Details:
Implement a callable or probe that attempts to connect to Redis and returns its status. Use fastapi-healthchecks or a custom function.

## 3. Add PostgreSQL Health Check [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Integrate a PostgreSQL connectivity check into the /health endpoint to verify database availability.
### Details:
Implement a callable or probe that attempts a simple query (e.g., SELECT 1) against PostgreSQL and returns its status. Use fastapi-healthchecks or a custom function.

## 4. Implement /status Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2, 23.3
### Description: Create a /status endpoint in FastAPI to provide extended application status and metrics.
### Details:
Design a /status route that aggregates and returns detailed health and status information, possibly including uptime, version, and results from Redis/PostgreSQL checks.

## 5. Configure Docker Compose Health Checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2, 23.3, 23.4
### Description: Add healthcheck configurations to Docker Compose for FastAPI, Redis, and PostgreSQL services.
### Details:
Update docker-compose.yml to include healthcheck sections for each service, using curl or similar tools to query /health and native checks for Redis/PostgreSQL.
