# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement CSV Export Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a service and API endpoint for exporting invoice data to CSV format.
# Details:
1. Implement CSV generation service
2. Create POST /export/csv endpoint
3. Handle large datasets with streaming response
4. Implement proper error handling
5. Add export tracking to Invoice model

# Test Strategy:
1. Test CSV generation with various datasets
2. Verify CSV format correctness
3. Test large dataset handling
4. Ensure proper error responses

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design CSV Generation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the structure and formatting rules for CSV export, ensuring data integrity, consistent delimiters, proper text qualifiers, and UTF-8 encoding.
### Details:
Incorporate best practices such as double-checking delimiters, maintaining consistent column structure, and validating data before export to avoid common CSV formatting errors.

## 2. Implement Streaming for Large Datasets [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Develop a memory-efficient streaming mechanism for exporting large datasets to CSV, avoiding loading all data into memory at once.
### Details:
Utilize techniques such as generators or chunked processing to handle large files, ensuring scalability and preventing out-of-memory errors.

## 3. Create Export API Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Develop an API endpoint that initiates the CSV export process and streams the file to the client.
### Details:
Ensure the endpoint supports streaming responses and can handle long-running export operations for large datasets.

## 4. Implement Robust Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Add comprehensive error handling throughout the export process, including data validation, streaming failures, and file formatting issues.
### Details:
Log errors, return meaningful error messages to the client, and ensure partial exports do not result in corrupted files.

## 5. Develop Export Tracking and Status Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.4
### Description: Implement a mechanism to track export progress and provide status updates or completion notifications to users.
### Details:
Store export job metadata, allow users to query export status, and handle retries or resumptions if necessary.
