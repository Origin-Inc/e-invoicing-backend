# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Email Polling Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a Celery task for polling emails every 5-15 minutes.
# Details:
1. Implement Celery task for email polling
2. Use Gmail API to fetch new emails
3. Filter emails for invoice attachments
4. Download attachments to Supabase Storage
5. Enqueue OCR job for each attachment
6. Implement error handling and retries

# Test Strategy:
1. Test email fetching with mock Gmail API
2. Verify correct filtering of invoice attachments
3. Ensure attachments are properly stored
4. Test OCR job enqueuing
5. Verify error handling and retry mechanism

# Subtasks:
## 1. Celery Task Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement Celery tasks to handle the workflow, ensuring tasks are short, idempotent, and follow best practices for background processing.
### Details:
Define modular Celery tasks for each processing step, avoiding long-running or monolithic tasks. Ensure tasks are atomic and can be retried safely if needed.

## 2. Gmail API Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Integrate with the Gmail API to fetch emails and their attachments programmatically.
### Details:
Set up authentication and implement logic to connect to Gmail, retrieve messages, and extract attachments for further processing.

## 3. Attachment Filtering [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Filter email attachments based on predefined criteria such as file type, size, or content.
### Details:
Implement logic to select only relevant attachments (e.g., PDFs, images) and discard or skip others before uploading or processing.

## 4. Storage Upload [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Upload filtered attachments to a designated storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
### Details:
Implement secure and efficient file upload logic, ensuring files are stored with appropriate metadata and access controls.

## 5. OCR Job Enqueuing [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Enqueue OCR processing jobs for each uploaded attachment using Celery.
### Details:
Create Celery tasks to trigger OCR processing on stored files, passing necessary file references and parameters.

## 6. Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5
### Description: Implement robust error handling and logging throughout the workflow to manage failures and retries.
### Details:
Add try/except blocks, logging, and retry mechanisms to each step, ensuring errors are captured, reported, and do not halt the entire pipeline.
