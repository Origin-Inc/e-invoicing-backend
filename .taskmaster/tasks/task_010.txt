# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement OCR Data Persistence
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a service to persist extracted OCR data to the database.
# Details:
1. Create a service to handle OCR data persistence
2. Implement data validation and cleaning
3. Map extracted data to Invoice and LineItem models
4. Handle potential duplicates
5. Implement error handling and logging

# Test Strategy:
1. Test data persistence with sample OCR output
2. Verify data validation and cleaning
3. Test duplicate handling
4. Ensure proper error logging

# Subtasks:
## 1. Service Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the core service responsible for persisting extracted data, providing interfaces for validation, mapping, duplicate handling, and error/logging.
### Details:
Define service boundaries, responsibilities, and interfaces. Ensure the service can be easily extended for future requirements.

## 2. Data Validation Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop robust validation logic to ensure incoming data meets required formats, types, and business rules before processing.
### Details:
Implement validation checks for data completeness, type safety, and business constraints. Integrate validation into the service workflow.

## 3. Mapping to Models [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Map validated data to internal domain models or entities for persistence.
### Details:
Define model schemas and implement mapping logic to convert validated input into model instances suitable for storage.

## 4. Duplicate Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Implement mechanisms to detect and handle duplicate data entries during the persistence process.
### Details:
Design duplicate detection strategies (e.g., unique constraints, hash checks) and define resolution policies (skip, update, merge, etc.).

## 5. Error and Logging Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Integrate comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the service to capture validation failures, mapping issues, duplicate conflicts, and persistence errors.
### Details:
Set up structured logging and error reporting. Ensure all failure points are logged with sufficient detail for troubleshooting and auditing.
